oflow.js - optical flow detection in JavaScript
===============================================
I made this little toy just for fun when I was traveling and had really long flight. The library allows you to detect optical flow in a video.

Here is an [optical flow detection demo](http://anvaka.github.com/oflow/demo/raw/index.html) which lets you to control a ball and see movements in each zone of the video.

And this little [Ping Pong game](http://anvaka.github.com/oflow/demo/pingpong/index.html) was also created on a plane. Right bar is controlled by the webcamera. Move your hand slowly up and down, to change the position of the right bar. Just moe your hands slowly do it gradually. Left bar is controlled by computer. 

I didn't have time to do the 'tutorial' or proper error handling, I'm sorry if it wouldn't work for you. Please [let me know](mailto:anvaka@gmail.com).
