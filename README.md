oflow.js - optical flow detection in JavaScript
===============================================
I made this little toy just for fun when I was traveling and had really long flight. The library allows you to detect optical flow in a video.

As a demo I made this little [Ping Pong game](http://anvaka.github.com/oflow/demo/pingpong/index.html). Right bar is controlled by the webcamera. Move your hand slowly up and down, to change the position of the right bar. The speed of movement is not really important. Just do it gradually. Left bar is controlled by computer. 

I didn't have time to do the 'tutorial' or proper error handling, I'm sorry if it wouldn't work for you. Please [let me know](mailto:anvaka@gmail.com).
